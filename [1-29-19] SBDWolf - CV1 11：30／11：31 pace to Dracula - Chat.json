I got the 2-cycle pattern but missed the turnaround jump. Later on in the same stream I got an 11:32/11:33 pace that I lost to the same reason.  This at least gives me confidence that I can get a much better time much sooner than I expected.","id":"371877597","created_at":"2019-01-29T18:48:29Z","start":0,"end":738,"length":738,"viewCount":16,"game":"Retro","chapters":[{"id":"","startMilliseconds":0,"lengthMilliseconds":738000,"type":"GAME_CHANGE","description":"Retro","subDescription":"","thumbnailUrl":null,"gameId":"27284","gameDisplayName":"Retro","gameBoxArtUrl":"https://static-cdn.jtvnw.net/ttv-boxart/27284-40x53.jpg"}]},"comments":[],"embeddedData":{"thirdParty":[],"firstParty":[],"twitchBadges":[],"twitchBits":[]}}
